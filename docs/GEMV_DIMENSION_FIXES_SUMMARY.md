# GEMV Dimension Fixes Summary

## Problem Description

The original row-wise and column-wise GEMV implementations were only working when matrix and vector dimensions exactly matched the lattice dimensions. For example:
- D4 lattice required 4-dimensional vectors and matrices with 4 rows/columns
- A2 lattice required 2-dimensional vectors and matrices with 2 rows/columns
- E8 lattice required 8-dimensional vectors and matrices with 8 rows/columns

This severely limited the practical applicability of the lattice quantization approach.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the encoding and decoding logic:

1. **Missing Padding Logic**: The implementations didn't properly pad matrices and vectors to make dimensions compatible with lattice dimensions
2. **Incorrect Blocking**: The code tried to encode entire rows/columns at once instead of blocking them into chunks of the lattice dimension
3. **Dimension Mismatch**: The quantizer expected vectors of exact lattice dimension, but received padded vectors of arbitrary length

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Matrix and Vector Padding

Both implementations now properly pad matrices and vectors:

- **Row-wise GEMV**: Pads matrix rows to make the number of rows divisible by the lattice dimension
- **Column-wise GEMV**: Pads matrix columns to make the number of columns divisible by the lattice dimension
- **Vector Padding**: Input vectors are padded to match the padded matrix dimensions

### 2. Proper Blocking Strategy

The encoding process now works as follows:

1. **Matrix Blocking**: Divide matrix into blocks based on lattice dimensions
2. **Row/Column Chunking**: For each row/column, divide into chunks of lattice dimension
3. **Chunk Encoding**: Encode each chunk separately using the lattice quantizer
4. **Chunk Decoding**: Decode chunks and concatenate to reconstruct full rows/columns

### 3. Updated Data Structures

The encoding structure was updated to handle multiple chunks per row/column:

```python
# Before: Single encoding per row/column
self.encoded_rows[block_idx] = [encoding1, encoding2, ...]

# After: Multiple encodings per row/column (chunks)
self.encoded_rows[block_idx] = [[chunk1_encoding, chunk2_encoding, ...], ...]
```

### 4. Comprehensive Updates

All related methods were updated to handle the new structure:

- `multiply()`: Decode all chunks and concatenate before dot product
- `multiply_with_sparsity()`: Handle chunked encoding in sparse computation
- `multiply_with_lookup()`: Support chunked encoding in lookup-based computation
- `get_compression_ratio()`: Calculate compression for chunked encoding
- `get_memory_usage()`: Account for chunked storage
- `get_blocking_info()`: Report original and padded dimensions

## Files Modified

1. **`src/gemv/row_wise_gemv.py`**
   - Fixed `_encode_matrix()` to block rows into lattice-dimension chunks
   - Updated all multiply methods to handle chunked encoding
   - Updated utility methods for new data structure

2. **`src/gemv/column_wise_gemv.py`**
   - Fixed `_encode_matrix()` to block columns into lattice-dimension chunks
   - Updated all multiply methods to handle chunked encoding
   - Updated utility methods for new data structure

3. **`src/gemv/lattice_quantized_gemv.py`**
   - No changes needed (unified interface already worked correctly)

## Testing Results

The fixes were verified with comprehensive tests:

### Test Cases
- **Small matrices**: 3x5, 7x4, 4x9 (neither dimension matches lattice)
- **Medium matrices**: 10x15, 20x8, 6x25 (neither dimension matches lattice)
- **Large matrices**: 100x50 (neither dimension matches lattice)
- **Multiple lattice types**: D4, A2, E8

### Results
- ✅ **Dimension handling**: All matrices now work regardless of dimensions
- ✅ **Shape preservation**: Output shapes match original matrix rows
- ✅ **Blocking information**: Correctly reports original and padded dimensions
- ✅ **Multiple lattice types**: Works with D4, A2, and E8 lattices
- ✅ **Quantization error**: Within reasonable bounds for quantization methods

## Benefits

1. **Universal Applicability**: Now works with any matrix and vector dimensions
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Still works with exact lattice dimension matches
3. **Efficient Blocking**: Properly utilizes lattice quantization for arbitrary dimensions
4. **Comprehensive Support**: All features (sparsity, lookup tables) work with new structure
5. **Transparent Padding**: Users don't need to worry about dimension matching

## Usage Examples

```python
# Now works with any dimensions
matrix = np.random.randn(17, 23)  # Neither dimension matches D4 (4)
vector = np.random.randn(23)

# Row-wise approach
row_processor = RowWiseGEMV(matrix, 'D4', 2)
result = row_processor.multiply(vector)  # Shape: (17,)

# Column-wise approach
col_processor = ColumnWiseGEMV(matrix, 'D4', 2)
result = col_processor.multiply(vector)  # Shape: (17,)

# Unified interface
processor = LatticeQuantizedGEMV(matrix, 'auto', 'D4', 2)
result = processor.multiply(vector)  # Shape: (17,)
```

The GEMV implementations now provide a robust, dimension-agnostic interface for lattice-quantized matrix-vector multiplication while maintaining the efficiency benefits of the original approach.
