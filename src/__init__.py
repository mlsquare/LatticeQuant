"""
LatticeQuant: High-Rate Nested-Lattice Quantized Matrix Multiplication

A Python library implementing high-rate nested-lattice quantization for matrix 
multiplication with small lookup tables.

This library provides efficient implementations of both classic nested lattice 
quantization and a novel hierarchical approach that achieves superior 
rate-distortion performance while enabling fast inner product estimation 
using compact lookup tables.

For usage examples, import from the specific modules:
- src.quantizers: Core quantizer implementations
- src.applications: Analysis and visualization tools
- src.adaptive: Adaptive matrix-vector multiplication
- src.utils: Utility functions and lattice generators
